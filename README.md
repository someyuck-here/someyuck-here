- Hi, I’m @someyuck-here
- My name is Samyak. I am currently a senior undergrad at IIT Delhi.
- I'm interested in Physics, particularly Optics and AMO Physics, with particular inclination towards experiments in nonlinear, ultrafast and quantum optics, and their applications in imaging, communication and fundamental tests of nature.   
- I’m currently learning in depth, the topics around wave dynamics and coherence theory, computational imaging techniques and optical communication systems. Apart from topics in optics, I am parallely exploring non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and quantum computation from the point of view coumputer sciences.
- I have been working on cascaded second-order nonlinear processes for photon pair generation in PPLN wavegguide at Quantum Photonics Lab, IIT Delhi. I will shortly start work on fiber-based distributed sensing on oil and gas pipelines, which uses Stimulated Brilluoun Scattering.
- I have an idea regarding imaging in presence of wired meshes by exploiting the information gathered by multiple or moving cameras. I am yet to start a dedicated work on the same, but am always open to discussions and advice.         
- I will be using this page to post the code (mostly Python) that I use to simulate phenomenon in physics and optics, or maybe some other general results that I find fascinating.
